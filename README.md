# HytaleRPC (Concept Plugin)

> ⚠️ **Warning**  
> This plugin is **purely conceptual**. Hytale’s client, server, and modding APIs are not finalized, and it is currently **unknown whether Discord Rich Presence customization will be possible, permitted, or supported**. Everything described below represents a design idea only and may change or never be feasible at all.

## Overview

**HytaleRPC** is a concept plugin for Hytale servers that aims to allow servers to customize Discord Rich Presence with their own live server information.

The goal is to give servers control over what players’ Discord profiles display while connected, rather than relying on a fixed or generic presence.

---

## Concept

The plugin would allow servers to define Rich Presence data such as:

- Server name or network branding  
- Current game mode or activity  
- Player count or lobby status  
- Custom text, icons, and images  
- Dynamic updates based on server state or events  

All presence data would be **server-defined**, allowing each server or network to present itself differently on Discord.
